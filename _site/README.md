Hi! I'm Jing Chung from Taiwan.

## About Me

I love cats and am an avid basketball player. Family always comes first for me, and I prioritize their needs above all else. Additionally, I enjoy climbing challenging mountains during the weekend and have a passion for camping. I'm planning to embark on a solo camping trip soon!
